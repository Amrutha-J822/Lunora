# Lunora
As students, we all understand how stressful life can get, from juggling exams and project deadlines to job applications and clearing out our student-loans. It often feels like we’re constantly racing against time. Now imagine how that pressure multiplies when adulthood hits with balancing work, relationships, finances, and personal goals. Mental health becomes not just important, but essential.
That’s why we thought of building **LUNORA** — a mental health companion app designed to support emotional well-being through everyday challenges. Whether you're feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or just need a small boost to get through the day, this app offers a safe space with calming music, an interactive chatbot, journaling, inspirational content, and more — all in one place. Our goal is to make mental health support more accessible, personalized, and empowering for students and young professionals alike.
